## What I hope to learn 🔔
🎯 Plan  
*  In the future, I intend to engage in work related to strategic analysis in the future. The analysis of various data, such as corporate financial data, industry data, market data, and so forth, is a necessary component of this job. Skills in data visualization will be essential.

✏️  Data Visualization Methods  
* I hope to learn how to do data visualization properly to help audience understand data quickly.  
* I hope to have a pleasing "aesthetic" for data visualization.  

✏️  Data Visualization Tools  
* I hope to learn how to use various data visualization tools including Tableau to tell story of data.  

✏️  Learn From Others  
* I hope to learn about different data visualization ideas from other students through the discussion board. I believe that everyone's understanding of data is unique, which can be extremely beneficial to me.
