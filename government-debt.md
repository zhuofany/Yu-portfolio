## Government Debts Visualization 

📍 **_First Visualization_**   
This is the original visualization from OECD. The chart below shows the debt-to-GDP ratio of 39 countries in the world in 2020. Since the number of countries in 2020 is more substantial than in 2021, the data of 2020 is selected for visualization.

📍 **_Third Visualization_**  
This is the other visualization created by Flourish. I divide the world's nations into continents and compare the changes in each continent's debt-to-GDP ratio over a five-year period using a grid of column charts.
