## Government Debts Visualization 

üìç **_First Visualization_**   
This is the original visualization from OECD. Since the number of countries in 2020 is more substantial than in 2021, the data of 2020 is selected for visualization.

‚≠ê **_Comparison of the three visulizations_**  
The first visualization is a single bar chart from OECD website. The chart shows the debt-to-GDP ratio of 39 countries in the world in 2020. Because each bar represents a country, we can use the chart to see which countries have the highest and lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in 2020. To compare which countries have ratios that exceed the OECD average, the bars for the OECD average are colored black. Compared with the other two methods, this chart is most suitable for comparing the national data of a certain year. However, the chart contains too much data, and the country names on the x-axis are slanted, making the chart difficult to read.   
<br />
The second visualization is grid of line charts. With a line chart, this pair of charts depicts the trend of each country's debt-to-GDP ratio since 1995. The most recent year of data is represented by the dots on the line charts. However, due to the large number of countries, audience is unable to visually compare the debt-to-GDP ratio data of different countries. Audience have to constantly move his/her mouse and eyes while looking at this chart, making it challenging to draw a precise conclusion. This chart, in contrast, is better suited to visually illustrating the shifting trend of the ratio of various countries.  
<br />
The third visualization is grid of bar charts. I divided the countries into continents and computed the average debt-to-GDP ratio for the OECD over the previous five years for each continent. The value of a country over a 5-year period is shown by each bar in the grid chart. Asia's average debt-to-GDP ratio over the past five years has been found to be the highest by comparing the data sizes of several histograms. However, this method cannot obtain specific national data or the comparative relationship between countries, in contrast to the first two visualization techniques.
