## Outline üìë
### Executive Summary üìù
According to statistics on coffee consumption, between 30 and 40 percent of people worldwide drink coffee daily. And in the United States, this statistic is even higher, at 66%. Coffee consumption reached a 20-year high, according to data from the National Coffee Association (NCA) 2022 report. When we are exhausted from studying, coffee may give us energy, and it may also be a useful social tool. Whatever the case, we must acknowledge that coffee consumption is rising worldwide and has risen to the top of the list of non-alcoholic beverages.  

Even so, there is persistent worry when people discuss coffee about the negative effects of caffeine and worries that it might cause severe health issues. Recent research, however, suggests that coffee is healthier than it is harmful.  

This project will focus on the health effects of coffee. I will begin by analyzing the consumption trends of coffee before exploring the relationship between coffee and health and whether it contributes to certain diseases. In order for everyone to fully comprehend the advantages of coffee and the standards for healthy coffee consumption, this project seeks to dispel some false perceptions about coffee by offering data support.  

### Project Structure üó∫Ô∏è	
**_Topic:_**  
Take Caffeine Concerns Less Seriously, coffee can be part of a healthy diet.  

**_Reader Perspective:_**  
As an adult with a coffee addiction, I am curious to know whether long-term coffee consumption is taxing and harmful to my body, as well as the ideal daily coffee intake so that I can keep my body healthy without giving up coffee.  

**_Call to Action:_**  
I can do this by drinking up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, roughly the amount of caffeine in 3 to 4 cups of coffee.  


### Story Arc :
<img src="story-arc.jpg" width="800">

The project will be divided into several stages:
1. Trend of offee consumption worldwide.
2. Caffein intake and content of daily food.
3. Customer's initial perceptions to coffee.
4. Coffee's effects on health and disease based on researches.
5. Coffee's could be part of the healthy diet.
6. Call to action: the moderate volume of daily coffee consumption.  

## Initial Sketches
### Stage 1: Trend of offee consumption worldwide
**_The popularity of coffee among global consumers is increasing year by year._**   

<img src="global-consumption.jpg" width="600">  
-> This chart shows an obvious increase of global coffee consumption in the last decade.

<img src="worldwide-volume.jpg" width="600">  
-> This visualizations show that coffee consumption is increasing year by year, and coffee has become the mainstream among hot drinks.

<img src="worldwide-text.jpg" width="600">  
-> I am also thinking of changing some charts into the text visualization to make numbers more obvious and cause resonance with audiences.

### Stage 2: Caffein intake and content of daily food
**_Caffeine is everywhere in our lives, but among these beverages, brewed coffee has the highest content. Therefore, it will cause people to worry about drinking coffee and consuming caffeine._**   
<img src="caffeine-content.jpg" width="600">  
-> This chart shows caffeine content of commonly consumed beverages. We can see brewed coffee wins the first.

### Stage 3: Customer's initial perceptions to coffee
**_Although many news have reported that coffee is not a great threat to health, most respondents still believe that coffee is harmful to the body._**

<img src="consumer-perception-text.jpg" width="600">  
-> This text and data visualization shows that nearly 80% of respondents believed that drinking coffee would increase blood pressure. Only less than 25% of respondents believed that drinking coffee would decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Stage 4: Coffee's effects on health and disease based on researches
**_Based on the research, we could come to a conclusion for the relationship between coffee and health._**

### Stage 5: Coffee's could be part of the healthy diet.
**_Point out the theme of the project to increase the audience's attention and interest._**

### Stage 6: Call to action: the moderate volume of daily coffee consumption

<br />
-> This is the last part of the project, which is for calling to action. I hope to graphically illustrate the most appropriate amount of daily coffee consumption and caffeine intake for adults. I also hope to bring the audience the conclusion they want to know.

Most of the data sources above will be used to analyze the data and redesign the visualization. Simultaneously, to better convey the correct suggestions to the audience, this project will refer to the ideas and conclusions of some research reports. The main background and inserted images will be from the previous website. If new and available data sources are discovered when the report is developing, they will be supplemented in due course.   

## Method and Medium ‚úàÔ∏è
The final project will be presented using shorthand. The above charts will be drawn with Flourish, Tableau, Figma, Infogram and other data visualization tools, and will be displayed on the final web page. The first stage may be divided into two shorthand pages. Charts and data visualizations of other stages will be displayed on a separate page.  

## Class Feedback üóíÔ∏è
1. For Stage 1, it's better to combine the first chart, and the left chart of the second visualizations. Because the data of the two charts have some connection with each other. I try another sketch here, and will change in the second part of the final project.  

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1676336745652' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;st&#47;stage1_1_16763366096520&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='stage1_1_16763366096520&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;st&#47;stage1_1_16763366096520&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='zh-CN' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object>

[Data Source 1](https://www.statista.com/statistics/292595/global-coffee-consumption/)  
[Data Source 2](https://www-statista-com.cmu.idm.oclc.org/outlook/cmo/hot-drinks/worldwide#revenue)  

2. At the same time, another suggestion for the second visualization is that since I merged the two charts, I can add a visualization representing revenue, which can be used with the pie chart to illustrate changes in revenue.
3. It's good to use a map to visualize the Top 10 countries that drinks most coffee. The suggestion from the classmate is that I can draw another visualization for "per capita".
4. For Stage 2, it's better to add a explanation for the first two categories. I will change the second category's title to "Brewed Coffee, at home, 12oz". In this way, the two categories can be better distinguished without causing confusion.
5. For Stage 4, the critique is that the color is confusing. Though I use the series of brown colors for coffee, the color of this visualization is not clear enough. Therefore, I would like to change the color and may use a green color for "benefit".
6. For Stage 5, the critique is that the size, color and bold style of the three numbers are confusing. In this way, the suggestion is to change those numbers into one color and size. And then I can put those three numbers horizaontally one by one.
7. For Stage 6, since the chart above says that moderate coffee consumption is 2-3 cups, but this says 3-4 cups here, it will be confusing. And the expression "+96mg" and the following "up to 400" also express unclear meanings. Probably need to re-adjust the whole layout, label the caffeine content of each cup of coffee on the coffee, and then use half of the color to represent the unmet 400 part.
