### üí° Reason
* When I was looking for a data visualization for analysis, I first looked for food-related reports. That is the report that came into view, so it is a topic that I am interested in, which is healthy food and the environment. Stacked column charts are used in many of the data visualizations in this report. However, similar stacked column charts give me visual fatigue when I read the report.  
* Another factor that drew my attention to this data visualization was its color, which is very cute and harmonious. However, there are more than ten colors and patterns on a chart at the same time, and the colors cannot correspond to the content one by one.  


### ‚úèÔ∏èCritique
I first using data visualization effectiveness profile to evaluate the original chart.  
This graph is intended to show that there has been little progress in the intake of health-promoting foods over the past decade. At the same time, the growth of foods that promote health and foods that have a greater impact on the environment and health are closely related to the development of the country.

üëç **_What does work well?_**  
* Usefulness: This chart contains a lot of data to express health and diet information that is meaningful and will serve as a warning to the audience. As a result, this visualization is of high usefulness.  
* Truthfulness: This visualization uses bars of varying heights to represent the intake amount of various food types, and the data expression is relatively accurate and authentic.  
* Intuitiveness: Stacked column chart which is used in this visualization is also well-known to the audience, with a high level of intuitiveness.  
* Aesthetics: The color matching of the chart looks harmonious and does not have many competing colors, which has certain level of aesthetic quality.  

üëé **_What does not work well?_**  
* Completenesss: The chart's title cannot be inferred directly from the column chart's data. Although I can see the data from 2010 and 2018, I am unsure of the benchmark or objective by which to measure the progress of the diet, so I consider its completeness to be only fair.
* Perceptibility: Furthermore, I will feel exhausted and confused when I look at this chart because there are so many different food types with various colors, patterns and shadings. I have to compare which color goes with which food type all the time. Particularly, the top portion of the bar has a very small area, making it difficult to see the precise value. Having too many colors will also detract from the presentation. As a result, perceptibility is significantly decreased.
* Engagement: This data visualization does a poor job of improving the interaction between users and data. The audience might be overly preoccupied with the visualization's color and drawn in by its adorable appearance, but they might not be interested in learning more. Engagement will decline as a result of the confusing information above.  

üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **_Primary Audience_**  
  
-> The general public who hopes to learn about healthy diets from around the world and diet experts of health organizations are the primary audiences.  
-> For reaching the audience, this visualization is 40% effective.  
1. It has an eye-catching and meaningful title, which is the most attractive information for these primary audiences. This chart has a certain aesthetic quality, the colors are more harmonious, and the style may appeal to the audience. Furthermore, the type of chart used in this visualization is more familiar to the audience, and they will be willing to interpret it.  
2. However, too many colors will distract the audience and keep them from focusing on the information to be expressed in the chart. At the same time, viewers want to see which categories or aspects of diet improvement demonstrate the effect. However, this graph only compares food consumption in the world and continents between 2010 and 2018. I'm not sure how this image can represent "The last decade has seen little progress in improving diets" to a general public who is encountering it for the first time. For diet experts looking for specific data, the information presented by this chart is also somewhat hazy. Therefore, when the audiences continue to watch this data visualization, they will slowly lose interest in it.

üí° **_How to change_**  
1. In response to the above problem, I want to completely change the type of chart. Because I can't accurately see the change in the growth rate of the last decade, and the comparison between different continents. Therefore, I want to construct a bar chart to represent growth rate change of different continents in the last decades. 
2. I also want to separate the types of foods that promote health from those that have a greater impact on the environment and health. In this way, it is easier for the audience to understand the meaning of data and thus increase its perceptibility and engagement.
3. In the chart, I want to use as few colors as possible to improve perceptibility.
4. I want to convert the original data into the annual growth rate of dietary intake. This makes the data more meaningful and understandable while also conforming to the information mentioned above.

üí° **_Thoughts of Critique Method_**  

This evaluation method, in my opinion, is quite effective because it includes all of the information required to analyze a data visualization.
* "Color effectiveness" can be used as an evaluation criterion. While this visualization has some aesthetics, the sheer number of colors makes viewing difficult anyway. This needs to be combined with the kind of chart to change the color. Although many colors represent many kinds, some colors are difficult to observe in the chart. Therefore the visualization is less color efficient.
* ‚ÄúType of visualization‚Äù is another metric. Although the stacked column chart used in this visualization is easy to understand, when there are more than 10 pieces of information that need to be listed, the stacked column chart will not work. Because it is impossible to clearly see the specific data of each category.
