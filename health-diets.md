### üí° Reason
* When I was looking for a data visualization for analysis, I first looked for food-related reports. That is the report that came into view, so it is a topic that I am interested in, which is healthy food and the environment. Stacked column charts are used in many of the data visualizations in this report. However, similar stacked column charts give me visual fatigue when I read the report.  
* Another factor that drew my attention to this data visualization was its color, which is very cute and harmonious. However, there are more than ten colors and patterns on a chart at the same time, and the colors cannot correspond to the content one by one.  


### ‚úèÔ∏èCritique
I first using data visualization effectiveness profile to evaluate the original chart.  
This graph is intended to show that there has been little progress in the intake of health-promoting foods over the past decade. At the same time, the growth of foods that promote health and foods that have a greater impact on the environment and health are closely related to the development of the country.
