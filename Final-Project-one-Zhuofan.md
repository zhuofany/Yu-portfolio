# Final Project - COFFEE AND HEALTH

## Outline üìë
### Executive Summary üìù
According to statistics on coffee consumption, between 30 and 40 percent of people worldwide drink coffee daily. And in the United States, this statistic is even higher, at 66%. Coffee consumption reached a 20-year high, according to data from the National Coffee Association (NCA) 2022 report. When we are exhausted from studying, coffee may give us energy, and it may also be a useful social tool. Whatever the case, we must acknowledge that coffee consumption is rising worldwide and has risen to the top of the list of non-alcoholic beverages.  

Even so, there is persistent worry when people discuss coffee about the negative effects of caffeine and worries that it might cause severe health issues. Recent research, however, suggests that coffee is healthier than it is harmful.  

This project will focus on the health effects of coffee. I will begin by analyzing the consumption trends of coffee before exploring the relationship between coffee and health and whether it contributes to certain diseases. In order for everyone to fully comprehend the advantages of coffee and the standards for healthy coffee consumption, this project seeks to dispel some false perceptions about coffee by offering data support.  

### Project Structure üó∫Ô∏è

Take Caffeine Concerns Less Seriously, coffee can be part of a healthy diet.  

**_Reader Perspective:_**  
As an adult with a coffee addiction, I am curious to know whether long-term coffee consumption is taxing and harmful to my body, as well as the ideal daily coffee intake so that I can keep my body healthy without giving up coffee.  

**_Call to Action:_**  
I can do this by drinking up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, roughly the amount of caffeine in 3 to 4 cups of coffee.
